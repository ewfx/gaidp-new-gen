Security holdings listed in this worksheet should be a subset of the line -by-line holdings reported in the Securities 1 schedule and use a consistent ID, Identifier Type and Identifier Value for m atching purposes. In addition, for qualifying hedging relationships reported on Securities 2, the unique ID reported for the investment security on Securities 1 must also be reported. There should be one row submitted for each distinct investment security hedging relationship. Use multiple rows to reflect one -to-many relationships: For example, if multiple hedging relationships apply to a single security holding, please list each hedgin g relationship affecting the security in a separate row of the Securities 2 file, repeating relevant details about the hedged security. (This treatment would apply, for example, if distinct hedging instruments – such as interest rate and foreign exchange hedging instruments – hedge different risks of the same holding and are accounted for separately, or if a fair value hedge co -exists with a cash flow hedge to address distinct risks.) Similarly, if a portfolio hedge is used to hedge more than one security under a single hedging relationship, please list each of the hedged security holdings in separate rows alongside the characteristics and allocable amount of the associated portfolio hedging instrument. If a hedging instrument hedges an investment security and also hedges assets that are not investment securities, report the amount allocable to the investment security (or securities) being hedged. Please refer to the following table for detailed instructions on each column of this worksheet. The abbreviati on ASC stands for the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification. In general, in the instructions that follow, the terms hedging instrument and hedged item follow their usage in the ASC.

Amounts should be reported in U.S. dollars (USD). The reporting of Securities should follow balance sheet classification of the FR Y -9C (e.g., Securities w ill correspond with Schedule HC -B breakdowns or be classified as Equity securities with readily determinable fair values not held for trading included in FR Y -9C, Schedule HC, item 2.c). Any securities not specifically excluded from this schedule should be reported . Additionally, the method of reporting individual security -level information should be consistent with the level of aggregation the company uses to assess impairment and measure realized and unrealized gains and losses on investment securities un der GAAP (ASC paragraph 320 -10-35-20). 7 In circumstances whereby the BHC or IHC or SLHC holds securities in both AFS and HTM categories within a given asset class, separate each security in to separate line items.
